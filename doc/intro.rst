Open Scientific Sharing with No Walls
-------------------------------------

SelectedPapers.net is a *federated* information sharing
service.  Instead of "locking up" your comments and 
recommendations within its own website - the "walled garden"
strategy followed by other services - it explicitly shares 
these data in a way that people *not* on SelectedPapers.net
can easily see.  Any other service can see and use them
too.  It does this by using *existing* social networks 
such as Google+, so users of those social networks can see your
recommendations and discuss them, 
even if they've never heard of SelectedPapers.net.

For example, if you're a Google+ user, comments you
type on SelectedPapers.net are posted on Google+ for you
(with your usual Google+ identity and associated audience),
with key hashtags automatically added to identify the
paper you are discussing.  

So: if you want to strip the
selected-papers network down to one idea, it's this:
given that social networks already exist, all we need
for truly open scientific sharing is simply a *cultural
convention* on a **consistent set of tags and IDs** for
discussing papers and research.

Getting Started
---------------

As an illustration of our open design, you do not even need
to create a SelectedPapers.net login.  Instead, SelectedPapers.net
authenticates with Google (for example) that you are signed-in
to Google+; you never give SelectedPapers.net your Google
password or access to confidential information.
To start using this, click **Sign in with Google** on
https://selectedpapers.net or on a paper discussion page.

* we suggest that you first create (in your Google+
  account) a Google+ Circle specifically
  for people to discuss research with (e.g. call it 
  "Research".  Of course, if you already have such a 
  circle (or circles), you can just use that).

* the usual Google sign-in window will appear (unless
  you are already signed in).

* Google will then ask you if you want to use
  the Selected Papers network, and specifically
  what Circle(s) to let it see who you have added.
  SelectedPapers.net needs this to see whose
  recommendations you want to subscribe to.
  We suggest you limit this to your "Research" circle
  (or whatever circle(s) of yours fit this purpose).
  There is no need to include circles such as Family
  or Friends in this.

Signing in this way does not give SelectedPapers.net
access to your Google password, confidential data
stored in Google, or any rights over your Google+
account.  For example, even when you are signed-in
to SelectedPapers.net using your Google sign-in,
it cannot see any of your private posts, only those
you posted publically (i.e. exactly the same as
what anybody on the Internet can see).

This initial version of SelectedPapers.net works
with Google sign in, and
primarily with arXiv preprints.
Support for other social networks such as Twitter
is coming soon.

Homepage
--------

The https://selectedpapers.net homepage shows recent 
activity such as paper recommendations and discussion.
It also lets you search for papers in the arXiv preprint repository,
or published papers via their DOI (Digital Object Identifier)
or Pubmed ID.  If you are signed in, the homepage will also
show the latest recommendations (from people you're subscribed
to), papers on your reading list, and papers you tagged as 
interesting for your work.



Papers
------

Papers are the center of just about everything here.
Here's what you can do with a paper:

* click to see the full text of the paper via arXiv.org or
  the publisher's website.

* read other people's recommendations and discussion of the paper.

* add it to your **Reading List**.  This is simply a private list
  of papers -- a convenient way of marking a paper for further
  attention later.  When you are logged in, your Reading list
  is shown on the homepage.  No one else can see your reading list.

* **share** it with others (such as your Google+ Circles or 
  Google+ communities that your are part of).

* **tag** it as interesting for a specific topic.  You do this either
  by clicking the checkbox of a topic (it shows topics that other
  readers have tagged the paper), by selecting from a list of
  topics that you have previously tagged as interesting to you,
  or by simply typing a tag name.  These tags are public; that
  is, everyone can see what topics the paper has been tagged with,
  and who tagged them.

* **post** a question or comment about the paper, or **reply** to
  what other people have said about it.  This traffic is public.
  Specifically, clicking the Discuss this Paper button
  gives you a Google+ window (with appropriate tags
  already filled in) for writing a post.  Note that in order
  for the spnet to see your post, you **must** include Public in
  the list of recipients for your post (this is an inherent limitation
  of the Google+ API, which limits Google+ apps to see only the
  same posts that *any* internet user would see -- even when you
  are *signed-in* to the app as yourself on Google+).

* **recommend** it to others.  Once again, you **must** include Public in
  the list of recipients for your post, or the spnet cannot see it.


  We strongly suggest that you include a
  **topic hashtag** for your research interest area.  E.g. if there
  is a hashtag that people in your field commonly use for
  posting on Twitter, use it.  If you have to make up a new
  hashtag, keep it intuitive and follow "camelCase" capitalization
  e.g. #openPeerReview.


Steal These Hashtags!
---------------------

In fact, if you want to go "full-manual" you can of course
use `these hashtags <hashtags.html>`_ (to write new posts, retag old posts, or
whatever you want) on your own, *without* even using the 
SelectedPapers.net website.

  invite a larger audience (everyone following you
  on Google+) to join in.
* by writing recommendations, you identify important new research
  that will interest others in your field.
* by suggesting new features or reporting problems, you help
  improve selectedpapers.net.

By Helping Build a Research Community Without Walls
---------------------------------------------------

* learn about what we're trying to do, by reading the original paper,
  `Open peer review by a selected-papers network <https://selectedpapers.net/shortDOI/fzkjw8>`_.
* by getting the word out about SelectedPapers.net, on your blog,
  in Google+ posts or communities.
* by getting involved in the SelectedPapers.net community group
  to make contacts with other Open Science efforts, journals,
  Pubmed etc.  Come talk with us on the
  `Open Science community <https://plus.google.com/communities/113901282230153759827>`_
  on Google+; please tag your posts ``#spnetwork``.

By Making SelectedPapers.net Better

* by improving user interaction (AJAX and JavaScript):
  `get started <https://github.com/cjlee112/spnet/blob/master/spnet/_templates/get_paper.html>`_
* by writing signin and query code for additional social networks
  (OAuth, Twitter API, Facebook API etc.):
  `get started <https://github.com/cjlee112/spnet/blob/master/spnet/twitter.py>`_

Measuring Interest: Scientometrics
..................................

A selected-papers network can greatly assist its users
by directly measuring the interest level of specific papers,
topics, etc. and applying that to rank what is most likely to
be of interest for each user.  If you wish to be part of
this analytics and scientometrics research and development,
get involved.

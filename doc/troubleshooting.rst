I tagged my Google+ post with #spnetwork but it hasn't showed up!
-----------------------------------------------------------------

SPNetwork relies on Google+'s search function, which (ironically) behaves
inconsistently.  You can get your post to show up as follows:

  - Go to https://selectedpapers.net/ and sign in
  - Click on your name at the top of the page
  - Click the 'get updates' button.  If your post is more than 20 days old, 
    adjust the dropdown box first.

Standard SelectedPapers.net Hashtags
####################################

A key principle of SelectedPapers.net is that anyone can tag their
posts anywhere (Google+, a blog, twitter, etc.) with the appropriate
hashtags, and they'll automatically be included in the index for
whatever paper(s) they discuss.  Right now this works with Google+, 
but we'll extend this to other sources soon.

how to tag your posts manually
------------------------------

If you make a post or recommendation directly from SelectedPapers.net,
the right hashtags will automatically be added to your post.
But you can also tag your posts yourself (even if you
have never logged in to SelectedPapers.net; indeed, if you have
old posts that discuss specific papers, you could go
back and edit them to add these tags).  Please remember
that hashtags cannot contain *any* characters other than
letters, numbers, and the underscore character.  So #generalRelativity
is a valid hashtag, but #general-relativity is not!  (we didn't
make these rules; Twitter did).

Here are the hashtags and paper ID formats to use:

* **#spnetwork**  This marks your post for indexing by 
  SelectedPapers.net.  This hashtag is required.

* **an ID for the specific paper** you are discussing.
  The specific tag depends on the origin of the paper:

  * **arXiv**: simply use the standard arXiv paper
    reference, e.g. **arXiv:1302.4871**; you can copy this
    directly from the arXiv website.  
    A single space after the colon is permissible.

  * **Pubmed**: simply use the standard Pubmed ID code
    as shown on any Pubmed search page, e.g. **PMID:22291635**.
    A single space after the colon is permissible.

  * **Digital Object Identifier (DOI)**: virtually all
    papers published in journals now have a DOI, which you
    can generally find on the paper's first page, or
    on the journal's webpage for the paper,
    e.g. **doi:10.3389/fncom.2012.00001**.  You can copy this
    directly from a published paper or search page.
    A single space after the colon is permissible;
    the word "doi" can be upper- or lower-case.

* while not required, we strongly suggest that you include a
  **topic hashtag** for your research interest area.  E.g. if there
  is a hashtag that people in your field commonly use for
  posting on Twitter, use it.  If you have to make up a new
  hashtag, keep it intuitive and follow "camelCase" capitalization
  e.g. #openPeerReview.

* while not required, we suggest that you also include a **URL
  for the paper on SelectedPapers.net**, so your readers can click to
  see the original paper and all discussion about it.  Unfortunately,
  clicking the paper ID in Google+ will not accomplish that,
  because Google+ does not know what "arxiv", "pubmed" or "DOI"
  mean, or how they should be handled.  You can get this URL
  by simply searching with a paper ID on the 
  https://selectedpapers.net homepage.

That's all you need!

Recommendations
...............

A central principle of SelectedPapers.net is that innovations
can spread most effectively if individual scientists simply recommend
the papers they consider "essential reading" for their own work,
and subscribe to receive recommendations from
other scientists whose interests overlap theirs
(and whose judgment they trust).  It seeks to facilitate that
process by unifying all discussion
about a given paper on popular
social networks (Google+ first, Twitter and others
soon).  So start making recommendations,
and SelectedPapers.net will do the work to help others find your
recommendations and subscribe to receive your future recommendations!

To mark a post as a recommendation, simply add one of the
two following hashtags:

* **#recommend**

  This means that you found the paper valuable for your
  research, and thus recommend that others who share that
  research interest would also find it valuable.

* **#mustread**

  This means you consider the paper "required reading" for your
  research -- it changed how you think or what you're going to do.
  This is the strongest level of recommendation on SelectedPapers.net.

General user actions
....................

* ``#question``: this post asks a question about the paper.
* ``#agree``: you agree with the paper.  This will
  typically be used as a lightweight "upvote / downvote" poll,
  an easy way for people to declare themselves on one side or
  another of an argument.
* ``#disagree``: you disagree with the paper.


Open Peer Review
................

* ``#valid``: the paper's claims meet your field's standards of evidence,
  in your judgment.
* ``#uncertain``: the evidence for a claim is not strong enough
* ``#unsupported``: no valid evidence for a claim
* ``#wrong``: you're sure a claim is incorrect (provide your evidence!)

* ``#precedes``: one of the paper's claims
  appears to have already been published by previous publication A
  (provide its paper ID).

* ``#assessing``: you intend to assess the paper's validity,
  at least in part.
* ``#assessingAll``: you can assess all aspects of the paper,
  because you are expert in all aspects of the paper, i.e.
  you have performed similar analyses using similar methods on
  similar data.
* ``#exit``: you intend no further consideration
  of this paper (barring unforeseen new information).

* ``#majorResult``: this statement applies to the paper's main claim(s)
* ``#minorResult``: this statement applies to a minor point that
  is not one of the paper's main claims.

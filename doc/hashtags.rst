Standard SelectedPapers.net Hashtags
####################################

A key principle of SelectedPapers.net is that anyone can tag their
posts anywhere (Google+, a blog, twitter, etc.) with the appropriate
hashtags, and they'll automatically be included in the index for
whatever paper(s) they discuss.  Right now this works with Google+, 
but we'll extend this to other sources soon.

how to tag your posts manually
------------------------------

If you make a post or recommendation directly from SelectedPapers.net,
the right hashtags will automatically be added to your post.
But you can also tag your Google+ posts yourself (even if you
have never logged in to SelectedPapers.net; indeed, if you have
old posts that discuss specific papers, you could go
back and edit them to add these tags).  Please remember
that hashtags cannot contain *any* characters other than
letters, numbers, and the underscore character.  So #arxiv_1234_5678
is a valid hashtag, but #arxiv:1234.5678 is not!  (we didn't
make these rules; Twitter did).

Here are the hashtags to use:

* **#spnetwork**  This marks your post for indexing by 
  SelectedPapers.net.  This hashtag is required.

* **a hashtag for the specific paper** you are discussing.
  The specific tag depends on the origin of the paper:

  * **arXiv**: the hashtag must begin with **#arxiv_**,
    to which you append the arxiv paper ID, with all special
    characters (anything other than a letter or number)
    replaced by underscore (_).  

    Example: arXiv paper 1302.4871 becomes
    the hashtag **#arxiv_1302_4871**

  * **Pubmed**: the hashtag simply consists of **#pubmed_**
    plus the Pubmed ID number for the paper.

    Example: Pubmed paper 22291635 becomes
    the hashtag **#pubmed_22291635**

  * **Digital Object Identifier (DOI)**: virtually all
    papers published in journals now have a DOI, which you
    can generally find on the paper's first page, or
    on the journal's webpage for the paper.  Unfortunately,
    DOIs are long, clumsy, and totally incompatible with
    hashtag rules.  Fortunately, there is now a "short DOI"
    standard that allocates each DOI a unique
    short code.  You can obtain this code by entering
    a DOI on the http://shortdoi.org website.  Then
    use a hashtag consisting of **#shortDOI_**
    followed by the short DOI code (only the letters and
    numbers following the slash (/)).
  
    Example: the DOI 10.3389/fncom.2012.00001 maps to the 
    shortcut http://doi.org/fzkjw8, so its short DOI code is
    fzkjw8, and its hashtag is **#shortDOI_fzkjw8**

* while not required, we strongly suggest that you include a
  **topic hashtag** for your research interest area.

* while not required, we suggest that you also include a **URL
  for the paper on SelectedPapers.net**, so your readers can click to
  see the original paper and all discussion about it.  Unfortunately,
  clicking the paper hashtag in Google+ will not accomplish that,
  because Google+ does not know what "arxiv", "pubmed" or "shortDOI"
  mean, or how they should be handled.  Here are the URLs to
  use for the three types of papers:

  * **arXiv**: just append the original arXiv paper ID (with no
    need to replace special characters by underscores) to the
    base URL **http://selectedpapers.net/arxiv/**

    Example: arXiv paper ``1302.4871`` becomes
    the URL http://selectedpapers.net/arxiv/1302.4871

  * **Pubmed**: just append the Pubmed ID number to the
    base URL **http://selectedpapers.net/pubmed/**

    Example: Pubmed paper ``22291635`` becomes
    the URL http://selectedpapers.net/pubmed/22291635

  * **Digital Object Identifier (DOI)**:
    just append the shortDOI code (see above) to the
    base URL **http://selectedpapers.net/shortDOI/**

    Example: shortDOI ``fzkjw8`` becomes
    the URL http://selectedpapers.net/shortDOI/fzkjw8


That's all you need!

Optional tags: Recommendations and Open Peer Review
---------------------------------------------------

A central principle of SelectedPapers.net is that innovations
can spread most effectively if individual scientists simply recommend
the papers they consider "essential reading" for their own work,
and subscribe to receive recommendations from
other scientists whose interests overlap theirs
(and whose judgment they trust).  It seeks to facilitate that
process by unifying all discussion
about a given paper on popular
social networks (Google+ first, Twitter and others
soon).  So start making recommendations,
and SelectedPapers.net will do the work to help others find your
recommendations and subscribe to receive your future recommendations!

To mark a post as a recommendation, simply add one of the
two following hashtags:

* **#recommend**

  This means that you found the paper valuable for your
  research, and thus recommend that others who share that
  research interest would also find it valuable.

* **#mustread**

  This means you consider the paper "required reading" for your
  research -- it changed how you think or what you're going to do.
